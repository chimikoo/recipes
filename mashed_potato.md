## Ingredients

- Butter 1kg (not a joke)
- Almond potato 1kg
- Milk 250ml
- Cream 250ml
- Salt

## Instructions

1. Peel potato then add into a high pot, add half the amount of potatos as water and steam them.
   > Important to not boil them but to steam them. Else they break and there will be to much water.
2. While that is happening warm up all butter, cream and milk in a pot.
   > Make sure to not boil it just bring it up to heat so everything melts. Keep warm

3. Drain potatos and crush them
    > Do not use a mixer it will cause the potato to get bad consistency.
   
5. Add the milk mixture just add little at the time not all together. We're not making soup.
    > Very important that the mixture is warm while you do it. Else you'll run out of strenght.

6. Add salt!
